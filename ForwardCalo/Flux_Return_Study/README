To run this module make it the usual way as indicated on the sphenix website
(e.g. running autogen.sh, then make, and make install)

To use it must do a few things:
In the G4_FwdJets.C macro inside the 'Jet_FwdEval' function replace 'JetEvaluator' to 'JetEnergies' leaving everything else the same.

In the G4Setup file for the part that makes the flux return and the Black Holes find the line that has something like 'SetActive->(...)' replace the '...' with 'true'

Once completed it should work with the regular Fun4All file and when run should generate a file that look likes 'g4fwdjet_eval.root': Note this name can be modified in the Fun4All file.
In this file there is an ntuple called ntp_truthjet.  Inside this ntuple will be the total energy deposited into the Flux Returns, and Black Holes.
e_FR_plus  = Total energy deposited in forward flux return
e_FR_minus = Total energy deposited in negative flux return
e_BH1      = Total energy deposited in Black Hole 1
e_BH_plus  = Total energy deposited in forward Black Hole
e_BH_minus = Total energy deposited in negative Black Hole
