Hi, Jin,
may I suggest to add to the library my analysis code which I just completed to test. It is not exactly conforms to sPHENIX standards but it writes root file with all graphical objects (histograms) which I could think about and it is very simple to use. All what it takes is to type 
.x runHelper.C(runKind, runNumber, eventsToRead=0, displayMode=3) where 
runKind  etc, display mode (1)-show event by event digititizations, (2) Lego plots in calorimeters (3) full processing and producing summaries (creates r# directory to store all TCanvases).
	      	      	   	    	  Edward
PS. Examples of the Canvases produced by code could be found in /sphenix/data/data01/kistenev/rootf/canvases/ (one subdirecory per run).
